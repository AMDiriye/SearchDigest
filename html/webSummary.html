Well, you can. But you’ll miss all the really fun things to do in and around Seattle. ------*-------Intern Benefits------*-------As an intern, you will meet new people, work on real projects, and get hands-on experience working in an exciting research area. Approximately 6-8 weeks before your internship begins, one of our Relocation Specialists will contact you by e-mail to provide additional detail on your travel, housing, and transportation options.------*-------Microsoft Research offers the following benefits:------*-------Georges Gonthier------*-------Those five innocuous words heralded the culmination of a project that had consumed more than six years and resulted in the formal proof of the Feit-Thompson Theorem, the first major step of the classification of finite simple groups.------*-------The theorem, first proved by Walter Feit and John Griggs Thompson in 1963 and also known as the Odd-Order Theorem, states that in mathematical group theory, every finite group of odd order is solvable.------*-------That might seem a deceptively simple definition to non-mathematicians, but Gonthier and his collaborators on the Mathematical Components project at the Microsoft Research-INRIA Joint Centre are anything but. Their achievement in completing a computer-assisted proof by the Coq proof assistant, developed at Inria, the French National Research Institute for Computer Science and Applied Mathematics, was acclaimed widely as news spread.------*-------Michel Cosnard, Inria chairman of the board and CEO, was quick to commend the development.------*-------“My deepest congratulations for this beautiful and amazing piece of work,” he wrote. “Of course, Georges Gonthier and his team deserve our full consideration. But I would also underline the quality of the Microsoft Research-Inria partnership, which gave to them the absolutely necessary conditions for climbing this Everest.”------*-------Andrew Blake, laboratory director at Microsoft Research Cambridge, provided further detail:------*-------“Georges and his team at Inria have been working on this proof of the Feit-Thompson or Odd-Order Theorem for six years or so, since he completed his proof of the Four-Color Theorem. That might seem a long time for one theorem, but in fact:------*-------    David Maxwell Chickering------*-------Max Chickering is a Mad Scientist who recently moved back to Microsoft Research.------*-------Max Chickering is a Mad Scientist working in Microsoft adCenter. Max spent ten years in the Machine Learning and Applied Statistics (MLAS) group of Microsoft Research.

I had much of that done by the time I’d completed the proof of the Four-Color Theorem. Then it was basic group theory, then algebra, then more advanced group theory, then character theory, and so on. There were lots of intermediate objectives, and we’d just move from one target to the next.”------*-------When Gonthier first suggested a formal Feit-Thompson Theorem proof, his fellow members of the Mathematical Components team at Inria could hardly believe their ears.------*-------“The reaction of the team the first time we had a meeting and I exposed a grand plan,” he recalls ruefully, “was that I had delusions of grandeur. But the real reason of having this project was to understand how to build all these theories, how to make them fit together, and to validate all of this by carrying out a proof that was clearly deemed to be out of reach at the time we started the project.”------*-------Along the way, he learned a few things—about formal proofs in group theory and about himself.------*-------“Stubbornness pays off,” he laughs, before reflecting on how the latest proof differed from his work on the Four-Color Theorem.------*-------“The Four-Color Theorem proof I basically did on my own,” Gonthier says. “Here, I worked with a team in more of a leadership role, and motivating the team was a new challenge for me.”------*-------Apparently, he proved sufficiently motivating. A couple of hours after Gonthier sent his original mail, Théry sent his own, providing a few facts about the project:------*-------“Number of lines—170,000,” he wrote. “Number of definitions—15,000. Number of theorems—4,300. Fun—enormous!”------*-------Initial enthusiasm aside, though, the hope is that the formal proof of the Feit-Thompson Theorem could lead to similarly big results in proofs of programs.------*-------“The Feit-Thompson Theorem,” Gonthier says, “is the first steppingstone in a much larger result, the classification of finite simple groups, which is known as the ‘monster theorem’ because it’s one of those theorems where belief in it resides in the belief of a few selected people who have understanding of it.”------*-------projects:lush------*-------leon.bottou.org------*-------You are here: ------*-------start------*-------projects------*-------lush------*-------s u m i t * b a s us u m i t b @ m i c r o s o f t . c o m------*-------background------*-------I'm Sumit Basu, a Researcher in the Machine Learning Department at Microsoft Research, Redmond. My research focus is on developing interactive, machine-learning based power tools to assist users in understanding and extracting answers from complex data - teaching material/textbooks, computer systems, sensory signals like speech or music, scientific data, document collections, or the web.  These power tools sometimes work by observing a user as they perform a task, then assisting them in their efforts once it understands what's going on; in other cases (as in teaching) they provide inputs to the user and adaptively refine their strategy based on what works best.  The interactive aspect comes from having humans in a tight loop with the learning algorithm: instead of getting a big batch of labeled data, interactive learning tasks involve a delicate dance between the human and the algorithm to achieve sufficient performance with a minimum of operator effort. ------*-------These days, I'm particularly interested in how we can use machine learning technologies to help human learners, teachers, and tutors at all levels with their educational goals.  This goes from the high school student who's studying for the SAT to the adult learner who wants the master the background information about a new company before her job interview. It's a deep and complex area, involving problems in document analysis, question generation, automatic grading, models of human memory, models of human understanding and skill level, and much more. If you're a bright graduate student interested in such problems and curious about internship opportunities, drop me a line!------*-------a brief bio------*-------Book Chapters------*-------Ye-Yi Wang, Dong Yu, Yun-Cheng Ju, and Alex Acero, Voice Search, in Tur & DeMori Eds.

Because of the variation in work, an application to Microsoft Research is considered separately from an application to work on a product team. If you are interested in working on a product team, visit the Microsoft Careers site.------*-------For summer internships in the Microsoft product groups in Redmond or Mountain View, please check out the Summer Interns at Microsoft Web site for additional product team information and guidance on how to apply.------*-------Microsoft is an equal opportunity employer and supports workforce diversity. At Microsoft, we believe that diversity enriches our performance and products, the communities where we live and work, and the lives of our employees. As our workforce evolves to reflect the growing diversity of our communities and the global marketplace, our efforts to understand, value, and incorporate differences become increasingly important. Women and minorities are encouraged to apply.------*-------You will receive immediate confirmation email upon completion of your internship application. Due to the large number of applications, we regret we cannot update every applicant via email directly. If you are not contacted by one of our labs, you have not been selected. Most summer internships for our US labs are filled by the end of April. Timeframes for international locations vary.------*-------Please send any questions concerning your application to internrl@microsoft.com.------*-------Sreenivas Gollapudi, Samuel Ieong, and Anitha Kannan October 2012------*-------Recent work in commerce search has shown that understanding the semantics in user queries enables more effective query analysis and retrieval of relevant products. However, due to lack of sufficient domain knowledge, user queries often include terms that cannot be mapped directly to any product attribute. For example, a user looking for designer handbags might start with such a query because she is not familiar with the manufacturers, the price ranges, and/or the material that gives a handbag designer appeal. Current commerce search engines treat terms such as designer as keywords and attempt to match them to contents such as product reviews and product descriptions, often resulting in poor user experience.------*-------In this study, we propose to address this problem by reformulating queries involving terms such as designer, which we call modifiers, to queries that specify precise product attributes. We learn to rewrite the modifiers to attribute values by analyzing user behavior and leveraging structured data sources such as the product catalog that serves the queries. We first produce a probabilistic mapping between the modifiers and attribute values based on user behavioral data. These initial associations are then used to retrieve products from the catalog, over which we infer sets of attribute values that best describe the semantics of the modifiers. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach based on a comprehensive Mechanical Turk study. We find that users agree with the attribute values selected by our approach in about 95% of the cases and they prefer the results surfaced for our reformulated queries to ones for the original queries in 87% of the time.------*-------In: International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management------*-------Publisher: ACM------*-------Ariel Fuxman, Anitha Kannan, Jessie Li, and Panayiotis Tsaparas, Enabling Direct Interest-Aware Audience Selection, in International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management, ACM, October 2012------*-------Sreenivas Gollapudi, Samuel Ieong, and Anitha Kannan, Structured Query Reformulation in Commerce Search, in International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management, ACM, October 2012------*-------Rakesh Agrawal, Sunandan Chakraborty, Sreenivas Gollapudi, Anitha Kannan, and Krishnaram Kenthapadi, Empowering Authors to Diagnose Comprehension Burden in Textbooks, in ACM SIGKDD Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD), ACM, August 2012------*-------Rakesh Agrawal, Sreenivas Gollapudi, Anitha Kannan, and Krishnaram Kenthapadi, Electronic Textbooks and Data Mining (invited paper), in International Conference on Web-Age Information Management (WAIM), LNCS 7418, Springer, August 2012------*-------Yi Yang, Simon Baker, Anitha Kannan, and Deva Ramanan, Recognizing Proxemics in Personal Photos, in IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition , June 2012------*-------Thomas Lin, Patrick Pantel, Michael Gamon, Anitha Kannan, and Ariel Fuxman, Active Objects: Actions for Entity-Centric Search, in World Wide Web, ACM, April 2012------*-------Rakesh Agrawal, Sunandan Chakraborty, Sreenivas Gollapudi, Anitha Kannan, and Krishnaram Kenthapadi, Quality of Textbooks: An Empirical Study, in ACM Symposium on Computing for Development (ACM DEV), ACM, March 2012------*-------Rakesh Agrawal, Sreenivas Gollapudi, Anitha Kannan, and Krishnaram Kenthapadi, Data Mining for Improving Textbooks (invited paper), in SIGKDD Explorations Newsletter, ACM, December 2011------*-------Anitha Kannan, Partha Pratim Talukdar, Nikhil Rasiwasia, and Qifa Ke, Improving Product Classification Using Images, in International Conference on Data Mining, IEEE, December 2011------*-------Rakesh Agrawal, Sreenivas Gollapudi, Anitha Kannan, and Krishnaram Kenthapadi, Enriching Textbooks with Images, in International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management (CIKM), ACM, October 2011------*-------Anitha Kannan, Inmar Givoni, Rakesh Agrawal, and Ariel Fuxman, Matching Unstructured Offers to Structured Product Descriptions, in International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD), ACM, August 2011------*-------Rakesh Agrawal, Sreenivas Gollapudi, Anitha Kannan, and Krishnaram Kenthapadi, Enriching Education through Data Mining (invited paper), in International Conference on Pattern Recognition and Machine Intelligence (PReMI), LNCS 6744, Springer Verlag, June 2011------*-------Ekaterina Gonina, Anitha Kannan, John Shafer, and Mihai Budiu, Parallelizing large-scale data processing applications with data skew: a case study in product-offer matching, in International Workshop on MapReduce and its Applications (MapReduce) 2011, June 2011------*-------Rakesh Agrawal, Sreenivas Gollapudi, Anitha Kannan, and Krishnaram Kenthapadi, Identifying Enrichment Candidates in Textbooks, in International World Wide Web Conference (WWW), ACM, March 2011------*-------Anitha Kannan, Inmar E.Givoni, Rakesh Agrawal, and Ariel Fuxman, Matching Unstructured Product Offers to Structured Product Descriptions, no.

It was shocking to the mathematical community at the time, because the proof lasted for 255 pages, a gargantuan effort that has proved to be quite mathematically innovative.------*-------Now with the formal, computer-checked proof of the Feit-Thompson Theorem, Gonthier and collaborators, most notably Assia Mahboubi and Laurent Théry of Inria, have extended the utility of the theorem.------*-------“Because the formal proof can be computer-processed,” Gonthier says, “we can get more information out of it. We can know that it’s absolutely correct.”------*-------Gonthier describes his initial emotion upon completing the formal proof as “elation” and reports that he immediately began to contemplate a full night’s sleep, which had proved difficult to obtain as the effort grew to a close. But clearly, it was a passionate pursuit.------*-------“The work is about developing the use of computers as tools for doing mathematics for processing mathematical knowledge,” he says. “Mathematics is one of the last great romantic disciplines, where basically one genius has to hold everything in his head and understand everything all at once.------*-------“Computers have been gaining in math, but mostly to solve ancillary problems such as type setting, or carrying out numerical or symbolic calculation, or enumerating various categories of common natural objects, like polyhedra of various shapes. They’re not used to process the actual mathematical knowledge: the theories, the definitions, the theorems, and the proofs of those theorems.”------*-------The possibility of doing so has been tantalizing but elusive.------*-------“My work has been to try to break this barrier and make computers into effective tools,” Gonthier states. “That is mostly about finding ways of expressing mathematical knowledge so that it can be processed by software.”------*-------The focus of the project was on developing tools for expressing mathematics.------*-------A clean and easy to learn Lisp syntax.------*-------A compiler that produces efficient C code and relies on the C compiler to produce efficient native code.------*-------A powerful dynamic linker/loader to interface libraries written in other languages.------*-------The ability to freely mix Lisp and C in a single function.------*-------A powerful set of vector/matrix/tensor operations.------*-------A library of over 10,000 numerical routines, including full interfaces to GSL, LAPACK, and BLAS.------*-------A library of image and signal processing routines.------*-------An extensive set of graphic routines, including an object-oriented GUI toolkit.------*-------An interface to OpenGL and OpenInventor.------*-------An interface to the Simple Directmedia Layer (SDL) multimedia library.------*-------Sound and video grabbing (using ALSA and Video4Linux).------*-------Libraries for machine learning, neural networks, Hidden Markov Models, etc.------*-------Libraries for computer vision and scene rendering.------*-------Bindings to the JavaVM API and to the Python C API.------*-------Free Software released under the GPL.------*-------Runs on Linux, MacOS and other Unix platforms.------*-------Conversational Scene Analysis: seeking structure and content from conversational patterns------*-------recent papers------*-------A.

I had a feeling once about mathematics -- that I saw it all. 
Depth beyond depth was revealed to me -- the Byss and the Abyss.  I saw -- 
as one might see the transit of Venus or even the Lord Mayor's Show -- 
a quantity passing through infinity
and changing its sign from plus to minus. 
I saw exactly why it happened and why tergiversation was inevitable -- 
but it was after dinner and I let it go.

Various incarnations of SN/Lush have been developed continuously since 1987, some of which were sold commercially by Neuristique until 2001. The system eventually grew into a full-fledged prototyping and development environment. Neuristique released the source code of the lisp interpreter in 2000 under the name TL3. Meanwhile, parallel versions of SN were developed at A version of SN was developed at AT&T Bell Laboratories and AT&T Labs between 1988 and 2001. AT&T released its code under the GPL in 2001. Transforming the various incarnations of SN into Lush was done at the NEC Research Institute by Léon Bottou, Yann LeCun, and HuangFu Jie.------*-------Lush has been used to build many successful technologies and products:------*-------Books------*-------Xuedong Huang, Alex Acero, and Hsiao-Wuen Hon, Spoken Language Processing, pp. 1008, Prentice-Hall, May 2001------*-------Alex Acero, Acoustical and Environmental Robustness in Automatic Speech Recognition, pp. 212, Kluwer Academic , 1993------*-------eXtreme Computing Group------*-------Redmond, Washington, USAEstablished 2009Managing Director:Surajit Chaudhuri------*-------The eXtreme Computing Group (XCG) was formed to develop radical new approaches to ultrascale and high-performance computing hardware and software, an area of research that the U.S. government has identified as critical for the future.

In 2005, he and Benjamin Werner completed a formal proof of the Four-Color Theorem, the first longstanding mathematical problem to be resolved using a computer program. In Formal Proof—The Four Color Theorem, published in December 2008 in Notices of the American Mathematical Society, Gonthier explained what was at stake.------*-------“For some 30 years,” he wrote, “computer science has been working out a solution to this problem: formal program proofs. The idea is to write code that describes not only what the machine should do, but also why it should be doing it—a formal proof of correctness. The validity of the proof is an objective mathematical fact that can be checked by a different program, whose own validity can be ascertained empirically because it does run on many inputs.------*-------“The main technical difficulty is that formal proofs are very difficult to produce, even with a language rich enough to express all mathematics.”------*-------Now that he and his team have achieved a second mathematical theorem completely proved in Coq, he explains the background behind the six-year effort.------*-------“Groups are very important objects in mathematics,” Gonthier says. “They describe sets of symmetries, or reversible operations, and they have been used to explain the structure of nature, specifically how atomic particles combine and fall into various classes. They’re also well-known in computer science, because group theory is the base for most cryptography schemes.”------*-------To illustrate the concept of “group,” he refers to a common but challenging brainteaser.------*-------“Think about a Rubik’s Cube,” Gonthier says. “It is a puzzle based on group theory, because the various operations you do when you turn the cubes around can all be reversed. If you do a couple of them, it all seems mixed up. But if you know a little group theory, you understand how to solve the cube.------*-------“The Odd-Order Theorem precisely says that groups that have an odd number of elements are solvable. Finite groups can be factored somewhat like integers, though for a more complicated multiplication. The basic group factors, called simple groups, also come in many more shapes than the basic integer factors, the prime numbers. Solvable groups, however, can be factored down to primes, like integers. They’re called this because they correspond to solvable polynomial equations.”------*-------Our research------*-------Connections------*-------Careers------*-------About us------*-------Microsoft Translator |------*-------Alice Zheng's Homepage------*-------2011------*-------Xiaodong He, Amittai Axelrod, Li Deng, Alex Acero, Mei-Yuh Hwang, Alisa Nguyen, Andrew Wang, and Xiahui Huang, THE MSR SYSTEM FOR IWSLT 2011 EVALUATION, Internaltional Workshop on Spoken Language Translation (IWSLT), December 2011------*-------Advanced Technology Labs Europe------*-------Aachen, GermanyEstablished 2003Director:Francois Dumas ------*-------Advanced Technology Labs Europe connects closely with European industry to incubate, validate, and deliver technologies that provide substantial, near-term impact.

Up to now, applying machine learning to data analysis has required close collaborations between domain experts who understand the data and machine learning experts who understand the algorithms. The problem is that it is easy to scale up the size of the data, but much harder to scale up the number of experts. My research focuses on easing the dependence on expertise by making learning algorithms more automated, their outputs more interpretable, and the labeling tasks simpler. In the past, I have worked on using machine learning to diagnose ailing computer systems and software. Some of the lessons learned from that domain continues to drive my research today.------*-------Research interests------*-------I have had longstanding interest in developing speech recognition systems that are robust to background noise. In my PhD thesis, I developed a model to express the cepstrum of noisy speech as a function of the cepstrum of clean speech which was the base for algorithms such as CDCN, VTS, and SPLICE. I also worked on a model called uncertainty decoding that estimates the clean speech cepstrum from the noisy speech as a distribution which is then integrated in HMM systems.------*-------I have also worked on various acoustic modeling techniques, including one of the first implementations of VTLN, vocal tract length normalization, for my PhD dissertation, using a linear model on the cepstrum. I'm also interested in discriminative machine learning techniques for acoustic modeling such as conditional random fields and neural networks, and rapid adaptation.------*-------I am interested in language understanding, machine translation, telepresence and multimodal systems.------*-------Microsoft Research Cambridge------*-------Cambridge, United KingdomEstablished 1997Laboratory Director:Andrew Blake------*-------The Cambridge lab conducts basic computer science research on a wide variety of topics, including machine learning, security, and information retrieval, and maintains close ties to the University of Cambridge and the University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory.Learn more about the Cambridge lab >> ------*-------Event details------*-------Date: 24 June 2013------*-------Location: Taipei, Taiwan------*-------Type: Workshop------*-------ICML 2013 Workshop: Machine Learning Meets Crowdsourcing------*-------The goal of this workshop is to bring together crowd-wisdom experts from different fields including computational economics, algorithmic game theory, information systems, cognitive science, human-computer interaction, and of course, machine learning.------*-------Related: Groups|People Machine Learning Groups Dengyong Zhou John Platt Paul Bennett------*-------Focus in France on Machine LearningChristopher Bishop, distinguished scientist at Microsoft Research Cambridge, discusses machine learning shortly before the opening of the Machine Learning Summit 2013, to be held April 22-24 just outside of Paris.------*-------GeoFlow Takes Data for a 3-D DriveWhat do astronomy and business intelligence have in common?
