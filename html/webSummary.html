<p>s u m i t * b a s us u m i t b @ m i c r o s o f t . c o m</p><p>background</p><p>I'm Sumit Basu, a Researcher in the Machine Learning Department at Microsoft Research, Redmond. My research focus is on developing interactive, machine-learning based power tools to assist users in understanding and extracting answers from complex data - teaching material/textbooks, computer systems, sensory signals like speech or music, scientific data, document collections, or the web.  These power tools sometimes work by observing a user as they perform a task, then assisting them in their efforts once it understands what's going on; in other cases (as in teaching) they provide inputs to the user and adaptively refine their strategy based on what works best.  The interactive aspect comes from having humans in a tight loop with the learning algorithm: instead of getting a big batch of labeled data, interactive learning tasks involve a delicate dance between the human and the algorithm to achieve sufficient performance with a minimum of operator effort. </p><p>These days, I'm particularly interested in how we can use machine learning technologies to help human learners, teachers, and tutors at all levels with their educational goals.  This goes from the high school student who's studying for the SAT to the adult learner who wants the master the background information about a new company before her job interview. It's a deep and complex area, involving problems in document analysis, question generation, automatic grading, models of human memory, models of human understanding and skill level, and much more. If you're a bright graduate student interested in such problems and curious about internship opportunities, drop me a line!</p><p>a brief bio</p>

<p>Bio</p><p>I am a researcher in the Machine Learning Group at Microsoft Research Redmond. Before joining Microsoft, I was a postdoc at Carnegie Mellon University's Auton Lab with Dr. Andrew Moore, and the Parallel Data Lab with Dr. Greg Ganger. I received my B.A. and Ph.D. degrees from U. C. Berkeley under the guidance of Dr. Michael Jordan.</p>
<p>Research Interests</p><p>I am interested in making machine learning easy to use. Up to now, applying machine learning to data analysis has required close collaborations between domain experts who understand the data and machine learning experts who understand the algorithms. The problem is that it is easy to scale up the size of the data, but much harder to scale up the number of experts. My research focuses on easing the dependence on expertise by making learning algorithms more automated, their outputs more interpretable, and the labeling tasks simpler. In the past, I have worked on using machine learning to diagnose ailing computer systems and software. Some of the lessons learned from that domain continues to drive my research today.</p>

I had a feeling once about mathematics -- that I saw it all. 
Depth beyond depth was revealed to me -- the Byss and the Abyss.  I saw -- 
as one might see the transit of Venus or even the Lord Mayor's Show -- 
a quantity passing through infinity
and changing its sign from plus to minus. 
I saw exactly why it happened and why tergiversation was inevitable -- 
but it was after dinner and I let it go.
                -- Winston Churchill</p>

<p>I am Research Area Manager in Microsoft Research. I manage the Speech group directly and oversee the Natural Language Processing group and the Communication and Collaboration Systems group. People in these teams contributed to many Microsoft products including Xbox Kinect, Ford SYNC, Voice Search, Lync. I also have a team that runs Microsoft’s machine translation service.</p>
<p>Research interests</p><p>I have had longstanding interest in developing speech recognition systems that are robust to background noise. In my PhD thesis, I developed a model to express the cepstrum of noisy speech as a function of the cepstrum of clean speech which was the base for algorithms such as CDCN, VTS, and SPLICE. I also worked on a model called uncertainty decoding that estimates the clean speech cepstrum from the noisy speech as a distribution which is then integrated in HMM systems.</p><p>I have also worked on various acoustic modeling techniques, including one of the first implementations of VTLN, vocal tract length normalization, for my PhD dissertation, using a linear model on the cepstrum. I'm also interested in discriminative machine learning techniques for acoustic modeling such as conditional random fields and neural networks, and rapid adaptation.</p><p>I am interested in language understanding, machine translation, telepresence and multimodal systems.</p>
<p>Brief Bio</p><p>Alex Acero joined Microsoft Research in 1994, became manager of the speech grup in 2000 and since 2006 is currently a Research Area Manager directing an organization with over 50 researchers and engineers working on audio, speech, multimedia, communication, and natural language. Prior to joining Microsoft, he was the manager of the speech group at Telefonica Investigacion y Desarrollo (1992-1993) and a Senior Engineer at Apple Computer (1990-1991). He has 93 granted US patents.</p><p>Since 2000, Dr. Acero is also Affiliate Professor of Electrical Engineering at the University of Washington and has taught Spoken Language Processing. He has participated in the PhD thesis committee of 7 students.</p><p>Alex got his Ph.D. in EE from Carnegie Mellon University in 1990, his MS from Rice University in 1987 and a Telecommunications Engineering Degree from the Universidad Politecnica de Madrid in 1985, all in Electrical Engineering.</p>

<p>Research Activities:</p><p>I am interested in algorithms and interfaces for improved information retrieval, as well as general issues in human-computer interaction. I joined Microsoft Research in July 1997. I work on a wide variety of information access and management issues, including: personal information management, web search, question answering, information retrieval, text categorization, collaborative filtering, interfaces for improved search and navigation, and user/task modeling.</p><p>Prior to coming to Microsoft, I worked on a statistical method for concept-based retrieval known as Latent Semantic Indexing. You can find pointers to this work on the Bellcore (now Telcordia) LSI page.</p>

<p>Research Activities:</p><p>I am interested in the development, improvement, and analysis of machine learning methods with a focus on systems that can aid in the automatic analysis of natural language as components of adaptive systems or information retrieval systems. My current focus is on contextual and personalized search. I am also actively engaged in enriched information retrieval, active sampling and learning, hierarchical and large-scale classification, and human computation and preferences.</p><p>My past work has examined a variety of areas — primarily ensemble methods, calibrating classifiers, search query classification and characterization, and redundancy and diversity, but also extending to transfer learning, machine translation, recommender systems, and knowledge bases. In addition to my research, I engage in a variety of professional service activities for the machine learning, data mining, and information retrieval communities.</p><p>While at Microsoft Research, I have been lucky enough to work with a variety of great interns — either as primary mentor or in broader collaborations.</p><p>Before coming to Microsoft, I obtained my Ph.D. from the Computer Science Department at Carnegie Mellon under Jaime Carbonell and John Lafferty.   Prior to that I worked with Ray Mooney and Robert Causey during my undergraduate days in the Computer Science, Philosophy, and Plan II Honors departments at the University of Texas at Austin.</p><p> With colleagues from Microsoft and elsewhere, I am currently a Track Co-coordinator of the TREC 2013 Web Track and a co-organizer of the ICML 2013 workshop on where Machine Learning Meets Crowdsourcing.</p>
