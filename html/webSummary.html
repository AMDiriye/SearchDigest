My research focus is on developing interactive, machine-learning based power tools to assist users in understanding and extracting answers from complex data - teaching material/textbooks, computer systems, sensory signals like speech or music, scientific data, document collections, or the web.† These power tools sometimes work by observing a user as they perform a task, then assisting them in their efforts once it understands what's going on; in other cases (as in teaching) they provide inputs to the user and adaptively refine their strategy based on what works best.† The interactive aspect comes from having humans in a tight loop with the learning algorithm: instead of getting a big batch of labeled data, interactive learning tasks involve a delicate dance between the human and the algorithm to achieve sufficient performance with a minimum of operator effort.†</p><p>These days, I'm particularly interested in how we can use machine learning technologies to help human learners, teachers, and tutors at all levels with their educational goals.† This goes from the high school student who's studying for the SAT to the adult learner who wants the master the background information about a new company before her job interview. It's a deep and complex area, involving problems in document analysis, question generation, automatic grading, models of human memory, models of human understanding and skill level, and much more. If you're a bright graduate student interested in such problems and curious about internship opportunities, drop me a line!</p><p>I am a researcher at Microsoft Research Search Labs.††During 2006-08,†I†was in†MSR Cambridge in the Machine learning and perception group. I obtained my PhD at University of Toronto where I was a member of Brendan Freyís Probabilistic and Statistical Inference group.</p><p>††† David Maxwell Chickering</p><p>Max Chickering is a Mad Scientist who recently moved back to Microsoft Research.</p><p>Max Chickering is a Mad Scientist working in Microsoft adCenter. Max spent ten years in the Machine Learning and Applied Statistics (MLAS) group of Microsoft Research. He continues to collaborate with the folks in MLAS, and hence the presence of his home page on MSR real estate.</p><p>Max is interested in practical applications of machine-learning algorithms. He received his Ph.D. in computer science from the University of California at Los Angeles and his Bachelors in computer science from the University of California at Berkeley. An unusual fact you might not know about Max is that he really enjoys discussing himself in the third person.</p><p>Papers Online</p><p>Bio</p><p>I am a researcher in the Machine Learning Group at Microsoft Research Redmond. Before joining Microsoft, I was a postdoc at Carnegie Mellon University's Auton Lab with Dr. Andrew Moore, and the Parallel Data Lab with Dr. Greg Ganger. I received my B.A. and Ph.D. degrees from U. C. Berkeley under the guidance of Dr. Michael Jordan.</p><p>Research Activities:</p><p>I am interested in algorithms and interfaces for improved information retrieval, as well as general issues in human-computer interaction. I joined Microsoft Research in July 1997. I work on a wide variety of information access and management issues, including: personal information management, web search, question answering, information retrieval, text categorization, collaborative filtering, interfaces for improved search and navigation, and user/task modeling.</p><p>Prior to coming to Microsoft, I worked on a statistical method for concept-based retrieval known as Latent Semantic Indexing.

<p>Teaching with Machine Learning</p><p> using machine learning to help students and teachers of all ages and all types of educational goals achieve their objectives more effectively and efficiently.</p><p>Research Interests</p><p>I am interested in making machine learning easy to use. Up to now, applying machine learning to data analysis has required close collaborations between domain experts who understand the data and machine learning experts who understand the algorithms. The problem is that it is easy to scale up the size of the data, but much harder to scale up the number of experts. My research focuses on easing the dependence on expertise by making learning algorithms more automated, their outputs more interpretable, and the labeling tasks simpler. In the past, I have worked on using machine learning to diagnose ailing computer systems and software. Some of the lessons learned from that domain continues to drive my research today.</p><p>Research Activities:</p><p>I am interested in the development, improvement, and analysis of machine learning methods with a focus on systems that can aid in the automatic analysis of natural language as components of adaptive systems or information retrieval systems. My current focus is on contextual and personalized search. I am also actively engaged in enriched information retrieval, active sampling and learning, hierarchical and large-scale classification, and human computation and preferences.</p><p>My past work has examined a variety of areas ó primarily ensemble methods, calibrating classifiers, search query classification and characterization, and redundancy and diversity, but also extending to transfer learning, machine translation, recommender systems, and knowledge bases. In addition to my research, I engage in a variety of professional service activities for the machine learning, data mining, and information retrieval communities.</p><p>While at Microsoft Research, I have been lucky enough to work with a variety of great interns ó either as primary mentor or in broader collaborations.</p><p>Before coming to Microsoft, I obtained my Ph.D. from the Computer Science Department at Carnegie Mellon under Jaime Carbonell and John Lafferty.†† Prior to that I worked with Ray Mooney and Robert Causey during my undergraduate days in the Computer Science, Philosophy, and Plan II Honors departments at the University of Texas at Austin.</p><p>†With colleagues from Microsoft and elsewhere, I am currently a Track Co-coordinator of the TREC 2013 Web Track, a co-organizer of the ICML 2013 workshop on where Machine Learning Meets Crowdsourcing, and a co-organizer of the CIKM 2013 workshop on Exploiting Semantic Annotations for Information Retrieval (ESAIR '13).</p><p>Publications and presentations by primary subject (or by year).</p>

My research focus is on developing interactive, machine-learning based power tools to assist users in understanding and extracting answers from complex data - teaching material/textbooks, computer systems, sensory signals like speech or music, scientific data, document collections, or the web.  These power tools sometimes work by observing a user as they perform a task, then assisting them in their efforts once it understands what's going on; in other cases (as in teaching) they provide inputs to the user and adaptively refine their strategy based on what works best.  The interactive aspect comes from having humans in a tight loop with the learning algorithm: instead of getting a big batch of labeled data, interactive learning tasks involve a delicate dance between the human and the algorithm to achieve sufficient performance with a minimum of operator effort. </p><p>These days, I'm particularly interested in how we can use machine learning technologies to help human learners, teachers, and tutors at all levels with their educational goals.  This goes from the high school student who's studying for the SAT to the adult learner who wants the master the background information about a new company before her job interview. It's a deep and complex area, involving problems in document analysis, question generation, automatic grading, models of human memory, models of human understanding and skill level, and much more. If you're a bright graduate student interested in such problems and curious about internship opportunities, drop me a line!</p><p>Research Interests</p><p>I am interested in making machine learning easy to use. Up to now, applying machine learning to data analysis has required close collaborations between domain experts who understand the data and machine learning experts who understand the algorithms. The problem is that it is easy to scale up the size of the data, but much harder to scale up the number of experts. My research focuses on easing the dependence on expertise by making learning algorithms more automated, their outputs more interpretable, and the labeling tasks simpler. In the past, I have worked on using machine learning to diagnose ailing computer systems and software. Some of the lessons learned from that domain continues to drive my research today.</p><p>Research Activities:</p><p>I am interested in algorithms and interfaces for improved information retrieval, as well as general issues in human-computer interaction. I joined Microsoft Research in July 1997. I work on a wide variety of information access and management issues, including: personal information management, web search, question answering, information retrieval, text categorization, collaborative filtering, interfaces for improved search and navigation, and user/task modeling.</p><p>Prior to coming to Microsoft, I worked on a statistical method for concept-based retrieval known as Latent Semantic Indexing. You can find pointers to this work on the Bellcore (now Telcordia) LSI page.</p><p>Research Activities:</p><p>I am interested in the development, improvement, and analysis of machine learning methods with a focus on systems that can aid in the automatic analysis of natural language as components of adaptive systems or information retrieval systems. My current focus is on contextual and personalized search. I am also actively engaged in enriched information retrieval, active sampling and learning, hierarchical and large-scale classification, and human computation and preferences.</p><p>My past work has examined a variety of areas — primarily ensemble methods, calibrating classifiers, search query classification and characterization, and redundancy and diversity, but also extending to transfer learning, machine translation, recommender systems, and knowledge bases. In addition to my research, I engage in a variety of professional service activities for the machine learning, data mining, and information retrieval communities.</p><p>While at Microsoft Research, I have been lucky enough to work with a variety of great interns — either as primary mentor or in broader collaborations.</p><p>Before coming to Microsoft, I obtained my Ph.D. from the Computer Science Department at Carnegie Mellon under Jaime Carbonell and John Lafferty.   Prior to that I worked with Ray Mooney and Robert Causey during my undergraduate days in the Computer Science, Philosophy, and Plan II Honors departments at the University of Texas at Austin.</p><p> With colleagues from Microsoft and elsewhere, I am currently a Track Co-coordinator of the TREC 2013 Web Track, a co-organizer of the ICML 2013 workshop on where Machine Learning Meets Crowdsourcing, and a co-organizer of the CIKM 2013 workshop on Exploiting Semantic Annotations for Information Retrieval (ESAIR '13).</p><p>Publications and presentations by primary subject (or by year).</p>
<p>Here are the slides from our recent UW-MSR Colloquium Talk on "Making Reading More Effective" (November 2012), which gives an early overview of some of the work we are doing in the education space.</p><p>We just presented our NAACL 2012 paper on generating quizzes from arbitrary text data, part of our efforts on teaching with machine learning.  The corpus from the paper as well as a video of the slideshow with narration will be available shortly.</p><p>Active Learning, Active Sampling, and Active Evaluation</p><p>J.J.

I had a feeling once about mathematics -- that I saw it all. 
Depth beyond depth was revealed to me -- the Byss and the Abyss.  I saw -- 
as one might see the transit of Venus or even the Lord Mayor's Show -- 
a quantity passing through infinity
and changing its sign from plus to minus. 
I saw exactly why it happened and why tergiversation was inevitable -- 
but it was after dinner and I let it go.
