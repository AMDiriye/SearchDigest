I am an Associate Professor in the Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) Institute at Carnegie Mellon University. Past Work. I received a Bachelors of Applied Science in Computer Engineering from Simon Fraser University in Burnaby, Canada in 1993. I received a Masters of Science in AeroSpace Engineering from Georgia Tech in 1995. I received a 2nd Masters of Science and a Ph.D. in Computer Science at Georgia Tech in 2000. For my dissertation, I researched programming support for building context-aware applications: The Context Toolkit. I was a member of the Future Computing Environments research group in the College of Computing at Georgia Tech. Gregory Abowd was my advisor. I was a Senior Researcher at Intel Research Berkeley from 2001-2004, where my title was Ubicomp Software Architect. At the same time, I was an Adjunct Assistant Professor in the EECS Department at UC Berkeley, where I was a member of GUIR, the Group for User Interface Research.
</td><td> 
I am a researcher in the Technologies for Emerging Markets Group at Microsoft Research India. My research focuses on building appropriate information and communication technologies that contribute to the socio-economic development of low-income communities, as well as the description and automation of biology protocols on platforms such as microfluidic chips. I received all of my degrees from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where I completed a Ph.D. in computer science in 2009.

Ed Cutrell manages the Technology for Emerging Markets group at Microsoft Research India. He is a cognitive psychologist with a background in cognitive neuroscience and has been working in the field of human-computer interaction (HCI) for more than a decade. 

Ed's research concerns the exploration and measurement of human interactions with information technology. Over the years, he has worked on a broad range of HCI topics, including input technologies, visual perception and graphics, intelligent notifications and disruptions, and interfaces for search and personal information management. His current research focuses on Information and Communication Technologies for Development (ICTD). In this work, he seeks to understand how people in the world's poor communities interact with information technologies and explores new ways for technology to meet their needs and support their socio-economic development.
