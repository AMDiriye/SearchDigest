<aboutMe>
I received my PhD from the University of Mumbai and M.Phil from the Delhi School of Economics. My doctoral thesis analyzed a variety of print propaganda in Tamil politics as instantiation of broader regional political culture. Before joining MSR India, in 2005, I lectured for several years at colleges in Delhi and Mumbai and have been part of the editorial team for the journal Economic and Political Weekly.

<researchInterests>
At MSR, my primary interests are the adoption and dissemination of information and communication technologies in emerging market spaces

Small businesses offering shared access internet, PC and mobile phone services: cyber cafés, computer training institutes, PC assembling and trouble shooting units, mobile phone hardware and software repairing units, networking and software servicing
Usages and sharing of media, communication and information technologies: The Internet/Mobile Internet, PCs, mobile phones and television
I conduct research in two contexts;

The urban middle-class home were technology is shared as a way to pool resources and disseminate skill and usage
The urban slum community were technology dissemination and appropriation are organic, intensely dynamic and a mix of formal and non-formal socio-economic relations
