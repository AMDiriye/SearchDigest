Ed Cutrell manages the Technology for Emerging Markets group at Microsoft Research India. He is a cognitive psychologist with a background in cognitive neuroscience and has been working in the field of human-computer interaction (HCI) for more than a decade. 

Ed's research concerns the exploration and measurement of human interactions with information technology. Over the years, he has worked on a broad range of HCI topics, including input technologies, visual perception and graphics, intelligent notifications and disruptions, and interfaces for search and personal information management. His current research focuses on Information and Communication Technologies for Development (ICTD). In this work, he seeks to understand how people in the world's poor communities interact with information technologies and explores new ways for technology to meet their needs and support their socio-economic development.
