<aboutme>Current Status. I am an Associate Professor in the Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) Institute at Carnegie Mellon University. Past Work. I received a Bachelors of Applied Science in Computer Engineering from Simon Fraser University in Burnaby, Canada in 1993. I received a Masters of Science in AeroSpace Engineering from Georgia Tech in 1995. I received a 2nd Masters of Science and a Ph.D. in Computer Science at Georgia Tech in 2000. For my dissertation, I researched programming support for building context-aware applications: The Context Toolkit. I was a member of the Future Computing Environments research group in the College of Computing at Georgia Tech. Gregory Abowd was my advisor. I was a Senior Researcher at Intel Research Berkeley from 2001-2004, where my title was Ubicomp Software Architect. At the same time, I was an Adjunct Assistant Professor in the EECS Department at UC Berkeley, where I was a member of GUIR, the Group for User Interface Research.

<researchInterests>
Interests: Feedback/intelligibility and control in ubiquitous computing, context-aware computing, toolkits and end-user programming environments, sensor-rich environments, information overload, ambient displays, privacy, human-computer interaction, machine learning. Current Projects: Intelligibility and control in context-aware computing, persuasive and self-reflective interfaces, modeling and predicting human behavior, usability and improved performance in active learning, creating salient summaries of experiences to diagnose and support memory issues, learning routines and deteting deviations to support dual-income families, augmented reality interfaces, and programming support for context-aware and sensor-rich environments (toolkits and programming environments). Look here for an up-to-date list of my research interests.
