I'm currently a PhD student studying at Center for Intelligent Information Retrieval (CIIR), in the Department of Computer Science of the University of Massachusetts Amherst. I am supervised by Professor W. Bruce Croft.

Research Interests
I'm interested in the problems related to effectively processing of complex retrieval models. Particularly, I'm interested in improving the efficiency and throughput of long and complex queries.
I'm also interested in the problems related to the effective distribution of search engine functions across cluster computers. This involves large scale indexing and efficient distributed retrieval.
I've been working recently on a new search engine Galago, it is hosted in the Lemur Project. Galago is a scalable and extensible search engine. One novel feature of this search engine is the extensible query language.
