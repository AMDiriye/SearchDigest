<aboutMe>
Hello! I'm a fourth-year graduate student in the Computer Science Department at UMass Amherst, and via cotutelle at Macquarie University, where I work in natural language processing and machine learning. My advisors are David Smith and Mark Johnson. I'm also occasionally in South College, pretending to be a linguist.

As of June 2012 I am a visiting researcher at the Nara Institute of Science and Technology working with Prof. Yuji Matsumoto, supported by an NSF EAPSI fellowship.

My research focuses on statistical models of natural language processing and acquisition, with an emphasis on joint inference, unsupervised learning and statistical relational learning. My primary interest stems from a fascination with how children are able to, with little exception, effortlessly acquire their first language. I develop models that explore this problem by examining how linguistic levels (morphology, phonology, etc.) interact, and how their relational structures can be leveraged to improve learning in the absence of labeled training instances and negative examples. Additionally, these models test different assumptions, biases, and learning mechanisms in an attempt to determine which best approximates human language learning, and which biases, if any, are linguistically universal.
