<aboutMe>
I am a researcher in the Technologies for Emerging Markets Group at Microsoft Research India. My research focuses on building appropriate information and communication technologies that contribute to the socio-economic development of low-income communities, as well as the description and automation of biology protocols on platforms such as microfluidic chips. I received all of my degrees from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where I completed a Ph.D. in computer science in 2009.
